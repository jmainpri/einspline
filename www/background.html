Basis splines were developed by Carl de Boor for the parametric
representation of curves, surfaces, volumetric data, etc.  The are
more commonly known as B-splines.
<h3> One dimension </h3>
As the name suggests, B-splines are constructed as a linear
combination of basis functions, which are hat-like functions of
<i>compact support</i>, i.e. each function is nonzero only in a
bounded range.  The basis is constructed in such a way as to guarantee
the continuity of the value, and perhaps derivatives of the B-spline,
depending of the B-spline degree, <i>N</i>.  

The B-spline basis is determined by two pieces of information:
<ol>
  <li> an ascending sequence of points, or <i>knot values</i>, which
  are abscissas for the spline function
  <li> the B-spline degree, <i>N</i>.  
</ol>
The degree determines how <i>smooth</i> the spline will be.  For
degree <i>N</i>, the value and first <i>N-1</i> derivatives of the
spline function will be continuous.  Cubic B-splines (<i>N</i>=3) are
perhaps the most common form, and have continuous value, first, and
second derivatives.
