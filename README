Known issues:
   GCC 4.0.2 (and perhaps earlier versions) has a known bug in
generating optimized SSE code on 32-bit machines.  The results of
using the SSE version may not be correct.  We suggest upgrading to the
4.1 or 4.2 line of gcc or using the Intel compiler, which is free on
Linux for noncommercial use.  Alternatively, disable the SSE routines.
